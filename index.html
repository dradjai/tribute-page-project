      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>There isn't enough html tags or CSS styling to emphasize how much this person means to me.  She is a true example of the American dream through hard work, persistance and dedication.  When I first met her 13 years ago and learned about her story I knew there was something special.  She was 31 when she arrived to the United States and couldn't speak English too well.  Originally from Cuba, she studied and became a doctor in a communist country where doctors only make the equivalent of $25 a month. She ended up doing a contract mission in Venezuela for a few years.  After this mission she decided to escape to the United States for a better opportunity.  Not knowing the the next time she would see her family she took a risk and got on a bus from Caracas to Bogota with the fear of being caught and sent back to Cuba.  She was able to get a visa and fly to the US from Bogota. 
      </p>
      <p>Once she got to the United States she had to navigate a whole new world and start over.  Luckily she found me, haha.  She started working at an electronic store in Bayside making $8 an hour while taking the bus every day to work.  Not too long after she worked her way back into the medical field starting as a medical assistant.  While doing this she enrolled in nursing school. Once finished nursing school, she passed the NCLEX and became an RN.  She didn't stop there.  Her goal was to be a provider so she enrolled in an advanced nursing program, became a Nurse Practioner and is now a member of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners.  Now she is an absolute Rock Star and working as a Nurse Practitioner for a global company.  She is one of the top providers with her commitment to her craft and hard work the sky is the limit. I couldn't be prouder.</p>
      <p>I only mentioned her career accomplishments, which is only a fraction of the accomplishments that she has acheived on a personal level.  She is a rock star, dedicated mother of our 2 children and the best wife I could ask for.  She has motivated and pushed me in everything I do.  She has always been pushing me to chase my dreams and has been 110% supportive of me when when I wanted to switch careers.  I couldn't be luckier.  </p>
